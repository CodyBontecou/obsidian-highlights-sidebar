## Spec

- Scaffold a new Obsidian plugin project (package.json, tsconfig, manifest.json, main.ts, styles.css)
- Register a custom ItemView that opens in the right sidebar pane
- Parse the active note content to extract: ==highlights==, %%comments%%, [^footnote] definitions, and optionally HTML <mark> and <!-- comments -->
- Display items grouped by type (Highlights, Comments, Footnotes) with collapsible sections
- Clicking an item scrolls to and highlights its location in the editor
- Auto-refresh on active-leaf-change and editor-change (debounced)
- Ribbon icon and command palette entry to toggle the pane
- Use TypeScript, follow Obsidian plugin sample conventions
- Build should work with 'npm run build'
- Write a README.md with install/usage instructions
- Mark the todo done when complete
